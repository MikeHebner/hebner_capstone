    <h3>This is what the project does</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To incorporate the SQlite database, I created model.py to handle queries and other database specific tasks.
        It treats each table like its own class, each having their own functions to query the database.</li>
        <li>I adjusted my original code from sprint 1 to work with a database, rather than a text file. getUserRating()
        , for example, returns the data as variables rather than writing them directly to a file. </li>
        <li>Getting user ratings for a specific show requires the imdbID. The function I created can take either rank or
        name for a given title, and it will return the imdbID.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Missing or Not Working</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>99% Complete. Everything works. Needs final review.</li>
    </ul>
