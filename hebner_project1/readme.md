    <h3>This is what the project does</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Gets the Top 250 shows from IMDB api and writes the response to a json file in the project directory.
            I did this to cut down on api requests.</li>
        <li>Gets the IMDB id for a show. Can give the function either a (int) rank or a (str) name.
            For example, 1 or "Lost" are acceptable inputs. Returns id as a string.</li>
        <li>Gets user ratings for a show given the IMDB id. Then formats the response into a readable format
            and writes it to the text file in the project directory.</li>
        <li>Formats the Top 250 shows, from the json file in the project directory, into a readable format 
            and writes them in ascending order to the text file in the project directory.</li>
    </ul>
