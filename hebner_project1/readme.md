<h4>Finished</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Complete refresh of database in one button.</li>
        <li>View Top 250 Movies & TV and Today's 100 most popular Movies & TV.<br>
            Displayed in table format and can be sorted by Rank (all tables)<br>
            or Popularity shift (Only Most Popular). Clicking on an entry in<br>
            the table displays the user ratings for the selected title.<br>
            The ratings, 1-10, are displayed on x-axis with the<br>
            number of votes on the y-axis</li>
        <li>Compare the direction (up or down) of the current Popular Movies & TV.<br>
            Both Movies and TV are displayed in their own pie graph.</li>
        <li>In theory, all entries are able to get and display user ratings.<br>
            Each user rating graph built does an api call to get user ratings<br>
            and then stores it in database. It overwrites an entry if it has<br>
            the same imdb_id.</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Unfinished</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Does not compare the Popular Movies & TV with Top 250.<br>
            This was next step but ultimately ran out of time and had<br>
            to move on.</li>
        <li>Pie graphs only display percentages, no hard numbers.<br>
            </li>
    </ul>
